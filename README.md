IronDB Persister
================

This projcet provides a very simple API to ingest RAW metric data into
IronDB using `flatbuffers`.

Ingesting metric data
---------------------

Ingesting data into a metric is as-easy-as specifying the self-explanatory
`IRONDB_HOST` and `IRONDB_PORT` environment variables and running the following:

```javascript
const irondb = require('irondb-persister')

irondb.persist({
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    uuid: '01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef',
    name: 'my_metric_name',
    value: ... ,
  })
```

Multiple metrics can be ingested in a single call:

```javascript
const irondb = require('irondb-persister')

irondb.persist([{
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    uuid: '01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef',
    name: 'my_metric_name',
    value: ... ,
  }, {
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    uuid: 'fedcba98-7654-3210-fedc-ba9876543210',
    name: 'another_metric',
    value: ... ,
  }])
```

A metric can be ingested by specifying the following required properties:

* `timestamp`: the timestamp of the data to persist, either as an ISO-8601
  formatted string or as the number of milliseconds from the epoch.<br>
  **NOTE**: if the number is less than 10000000000 (`1970-04-26T17:46:40.000Z`)
  then it will be considered to be the number of *seconds* from the epoch.
* `uuid`: the check UUID of the metric
* `name`: the metric name
* `value`: the value to persist, either a string, number or `null`

The following optional properties can also be specified:

* `type`: (either `number` or `string`) this is required when `value` is `null`
  in order to determine whether to ingest the *absent value* as a number or as
  a string
* `checkName`: the name to associate with the check
* `account`: (defaults to `0` *zero*) the number of the account to associate
  with the check
* `tags`: an array of `key:value` tags to associate with the check

Schema
------

A JSON schema for the metric is available in [schema.js](./metric/schema.js)

Other functions
---------------

The `irondb-persister` API exposes few other functions for fine-grained control

* `init(host, port)`: to initialize IronDB programmatically, withou requiring
  the presence of the two `IRONDB_HOST` and `IRONDB_PORT` environment variables.
* `parse(buffer)`: parse a *flatbuffer* into either a metric or array thereof.
* `serialize(metricOrArray)`: serialize a metric, or an array thereof into
  a `CIRM` or `CIRL` *flatbuffer*.
* `validate(metricOrArray)`: used before serialization per persistence, this
  validates that the metric (or array thereof) is syntactically correct
